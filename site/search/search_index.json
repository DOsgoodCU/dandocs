To use them to fix index insurance experts must clean the data, similar to the cleaning process in a clinical study.

This information, along with historical yields allows local experts to determine standards for what needs insurance should address. Thanks to Zachary Huang and others at The  Columbia University's Data Science Institute for making this possible.  These will be reconciled with yield data and satellites in later steps</p>"},{"location":"#grammar-translating-farmer-needs-and-satellite-data-into-insurance-formulas","title":"Grammar translating farmer needs and satellite data into insurance formulas","text":"<p>The solution uses input from the farmers that can directly be used in designing better indexes: What years were the most challenging? And what times during the year they are most at risk?  Government experts check if historical satellite datasets during the risky times of year reflect the bad years farmers reported to find improvements.  These are cross checked against the historical yield data, and the documented crop agronomics.  This process provides the information that the farmers themselves can directly review and approve, refuse, or improve in the next round of crowdsourcing. </p> <p>If the agreement is low, there are problems that need to be solved for the insurance to be responsible.  If agreement is high, it is worth moving forward. </p> <p>The link below connects to the tool that Zambian experts are using to understand the potential for improving index insurance</p> <p> User: BETTERINDEXES, Password: IRI <p>https://fist-shiny.iri.columbia.edu/shiny_apps/Apps/Zambia_Window_consolidation_app/ </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>You can select nearly  any district in Zambia and then drag the timing blue bars for different satellites/algorithms to see what the agreement is between the satellites, farmers recollections, and the government yield datasets.
